## Concepts

### v1 - Interactive Canvas
Cursor-reactive painting experience. Move your mouse to create colorful particle trails. Blurs the line between portfolio and art piece.

### v2 - Code Poetry
Monospace aesthetic with syntax-highlighted "code" that describes the person. Tabbed interface mimics an IDE.

### v3 - Dual Identity
Split-screen design representing the engineer/artist duality. Hover to expand each side.

### v4 - Schiefewelt (Crooked World)
Everything is intentionally tilted. Bold typography, skewed perspectives, playing with the "Schiefewelt" theme.

### v5 - Kinetic Typography
Animated marquees, floating words, and smooth scroll animations. High contrast black/white with motion.

### v6 - Particle Text Formation
Floating particles that animate into forming text when clicking navigation bubbles. GSAP-powered smooth transitions.

### v7 - Glitch/Cyberpunk
CRT scanlines, RGB glitch effects, neon colors. Retro-futuristic cyberpunk aesthetic with animated distortions.

### v8 - Morphing Blob
Soft gradient blobs that morph and float in the background. Minimal typography with a cursor-following glow effect.

### v9 - 3D Cards
Interactive cards with perspective tilt on hover. Gradient backgrounds with floating decorative elements.

### v10 - Brutalist
Raw, stark design with heavy borders, bold uppercase typography, and high contrast. No frills, maximum impact.

### v11 - Terminal/Matrix
Green-on-black terminal aesthetic with ASCII art, matrix rain background, and command-line interface styling.
