## Concepts

### v1 - Interactive Canvas
Cursor-reactive painting experience. Move your mouse to create colorful particle trails. Blurs the line between portfolio and art piece.

### v2 - Code Poetry
Monospace aesthetic with syntax-highlighted "code" that describes the person. Tabbed interface mimics an IDE.

### v3 - Dual Identity
Split-screen design representing the engineer/artist duality. Hover to expand each side.

### v4 - Schiefewelt (Crooked World)
Everything is intentionally tilted. Bold typography, skewed perspectives, playing with the "Schiefewelt" theme.

### v5 - Kinetic Typography
Animated marquees, floating words, and smooth scroll animations. High contrast black/white with motion.
